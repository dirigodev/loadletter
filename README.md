NodeJS thermal printing using [thermalprinter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/thermalprinter).

## Installation

If you don't have it already, you'll need to install Cairo. For system-specific installation visit the [node-canvas Wiki](https://github.com/Automattic/node-canvas/wiki/_pages).

You can quickly install Cairo and its dependencies for OS X using the one liner below:

`$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LearnBoost/node-canvas/master/install -O - | sh`

or if you use MacPorts

`sudo port install pkgconfig libpng giflib freetype libpixman cairo`

Once you have Cairo installed you can install thermalprinter with

`npm install thermalprinter --save`
